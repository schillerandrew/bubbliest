> ## Project Overview

Juggling large or complicated shopping lists can be difficult, whether you're working with a text thread on your phone, or perhaps a list that was jotted down on paper. Bubbliest is an easier way to manage lists, by taking in text messages and threads, and turning each item from your list into a customizable "bubble" object on your phone screen.

> ## Features

- "Kickoff" prompt that allows user to input a list
- Convert one or more text messages, threads, etc into "bubble" objects
- Direct editing of the text in any bubble
- Controls menu (completed, deletion, grouping, etc) that replaces the kickoff prompt
- Bubble customization:
  - colors/patterns
  - note field
  - grouping
  - flagging/tagging/numbering (completed, delete, etc)
- Filtering and managing of bubbles:
  - Does every item in your list start with a hyphen? Easy way to remove hyphens across one or all bubbles
  - Remove other unwanted characters such as commas
  - Break apart one bubble into separate bubbles, or combine multiple bubbles into one

### Future Features

- sessionStorage
